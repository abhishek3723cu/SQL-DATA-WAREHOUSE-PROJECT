# 🏗️ SQL Data Warehouse Project

## 1. Project Overview

The **SQL Data Warehouse Project** focuses on designing and implementing a **robust, scalable, and well-structured data warehouse**.  
It integrates multiple data sources, transforms raw data into meaningful insights, and ensures **data integrity** across all layers of the ETL process.

This project aligns with modern data engineering principles such as:
- **Separation of Concerns (SOC)**
- **Data Modeling**
- **Data Quality Assurance**

Together, these make it a reliable foundation for analytics and reporting.

## 2. Data Architecture

The warehouse follows a **layered architecture** to separate raw ingestion, transformation, and presentation.  
Each layer improves **performance**, **traceability**, and **governance**.

| Layer | Purpose | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Bronze Layer (Raw Data)** | Ingestion | Stores raw, unprocessed data from various source systems. |
| **Silver Layer (Cleaned Data)** | Transformation | Cleans, validates, and integrates data from multiple sources. |
| **Gold Layer (Curated Data)** | Presentation | Provides analytics-ready data for dashboards and business insights. |

This structure simplifies maintenance, improves scalability, and ensures that data transformations are transparent and auditable.

---

## 3. ETL Process

The **Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)** process is the backbone of the data warehouse.

- **Extract:** Data is collected from multiple heterogeneous sources.  
- **Transform:** Business rules, cleaning, and joins are applied to standardize the data.  
- **Load:** Data is stored into the structured layers (**Bronze → Silver → Gold**) for analysis.  

Performance optimization techniques such as **Bulk Insert** are used to handle large-scale data efficiently.

## 4. Data Quality and Governance

Data quality is maintained through **rigorous SQL checks** and **standardized documentation**.  
The following key files ensure governance and reliability:

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| 🟡 **quality_checks_gold.sql** | Performs advanced validations on curated datasets in the **Gold layer**, ensuring data consistency and accuracy before reporting. |
| ⚙️ **quality_checks_silver.sql** | Validates transformation logic and identifies anomalies in the **Silver layer**, ensuring data reliability before promotion to Gold. |
| 📚 **data_catalog.md** | Acts as a detailed **data dictionary**, listing all tables, columns, data types, and relationships for transparency and discoverability. |
| 🧩 **naming_conventions.md** | Defines unified naming rules for all warehouse entities (tables, columns, and views) to maintain clarity and scalability. |

Together, these files form the **Data Quality & Documentation Hub** — the governance center of the project.

## 5. Data Modeling

Data is modeled following **Dimensional Modeling principles**, leveraging **Fact** and **Dimension tables**.  
This enables efficient querying, simplifies analytics, and enhances report performance.

### Key Modeling Decisions
- ⭐ **Star Schema Design** — for simplicity and faster queries.  
- 🕒 **Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD)** — to track historical data changes.  
- 🔑 **Surrogate Keys** — to ensure referential integrity and consistency.

---

## 6. Data Integration

The integration process ensures smooth and reliable **data flow** between multiple systems.  
It includes:
- Mapping source data to the warehouse schema  
- Aligning transformations with business rules  
- Automating scheduled ETL jobs for consistent updates

---

## 7. Documentation and Version Control

All scripts and documents are maintained in **Git** for:
- Version tracking  
- Collaboration across teams  
- Controlled and auditable updates  

This ensures every modification in logic, schema, or data flow remains traceable.

## 8. Project Outcomes

✅ Improved **data consistency** and **accuracy** through structured quality checks  
⚡ Streamlined **ETL pipelines** for scalable data processing  
📊 Clear **data lineage and documentation** for better team collaboration  
🚀 Enhanced **reporting performance** with optimized Gold layer data
